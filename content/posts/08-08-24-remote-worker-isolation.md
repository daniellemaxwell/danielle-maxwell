I've been working from home for about 6 years. Before I became a software developer, I taught English as a second/foreign language online for a few years. I loved the flexibility and when I made the decision to not only switch careers but also give up being self-employed, finding a remote gig was priority for me. 

Thankfully, I was offered a role with a company that's fully distributed. I was definitely ecstatic about keeping some semblance of normality because it had been a while since I last worked in an office setting (fingers crossed I never have to go back).

Since I primarily worked with adult students who wanted to improve their conversational skills, I used to talk a lot. 

The lessons would range from 30 minutes to an hour. I even once had a student who preferred 90 minutes lessons. When I made unwise scheduling decisions, I could easily end up having 9 conversations a day.

All of this to say that it was a bit of a shock to my system when I wasn't interacting with others anywhere near as much after I started my job. 

In the beginning, there was onboarding and I had some co-working sessions. There were meetings and I know there were several "I need help with x" calls, but it wasn't the same.

Everyone has work to do and having the time to focus on it is important. In fact, I even enjoy my no meeting days. At the same time, it can be difficult to adjust to.

So, how do I avoid feeling isolated. In my experience, this has been the perfect excuse to find a new hobby. While working from home, I joined a weightlifting group. Working out with others for 2 hours a week such a positive impact on my mental health.
