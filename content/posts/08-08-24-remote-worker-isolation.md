I've been working from home for about six years. Before I became a software developer, I taught English as a second/foreign language online for a few years. It's been so long since I last worked in a traditional office setting that working remotely has essentially become the norm for me.

I love all the benefits that come with working from home. I don't have to sit in Atlanta traffic, I can wear shorts all day, and no one will look at me strangely when I talk to myself out loud.

Of course, with everything there are pros and cons. In my opinion, one of the main drawbacks of working from home is that it can be isolating. When I taught, there were days where I realized that I was barely making time to have conversations outside of the ones I was being paid to have.

Now, as a software developer, some days I don't interact much with my team. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because I enjoy having days without meetings. 

Don't get me wrong, I like my colleagues (no I didn't write that because some of them may read this), but it's also nice to have a day where I can focus on whatever I'm working on.

Overcoming isolation can be a struggle and there could be other factors contributing to it beyond working remotely. I'm definitely not an expert here, but in my experience, joining a group activity is a great way to socialize.

As an example, I joined a weightlifting group a few years ago. Not only did I get into a regular habit of exercise, but I also got to be around others who also wanted to talk about terrible reality TV shows.

Making time to regularly meet up with a colleague and not talk about work may also be helpful. Just because you're co-workers it doesn't mean that you can't make time to have non-work conversations. Eating lunch together or just having a chat once a week are great ways to interact.
