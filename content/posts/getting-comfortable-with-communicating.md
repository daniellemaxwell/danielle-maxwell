Next month, I will have been at the company that pays me for two years. I have grown so much over the past couple of years, and with this anniversary approaching I have been reflecting on areas for personal and professional improvement. 

There are so many things I'd like to do and one is to become a better communicator. I'm not terrible or anything like that, but talking is so hard.

Don't get me wrong, I can talk for a very long time about several sports and why TV shows should not have more than 18 episodes per season. However, if you ask me what I'm currently working on I will have to fight internally to ensure that I don't look like a deer caught in headlights.

Every time I submit to a CFP, I briefly try to talk myself out of it because what if I get chosen and then have to speak in front of people? Not only that but what will I do when people ask me questions? To be honest, I cringed a little after writing that.

But if speaking is hard, then let me tell you writing is so much worse. Writing has to be one of the most painful experiences I put myself through.

At the same time, I've gained so much from giving talks and writing blogs. It's helped me learn so much and I wouldn't trade that for anything. So, over the next year I've decided that my goal is not to become a better communicator but to feel more comfortable doing it. 

Let's see how it goes.
