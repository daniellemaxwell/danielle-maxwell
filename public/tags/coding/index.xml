      <description>It has recently come to my attention that I often find reasons to create a website. Before learning how to code, I would make a WordPress site once I had an idea for anything.&#xA;None of these ideas went anywhere, btw. Marketing is important, but that&amp;rsquo;s a topic for another day.&#xA;Earlier this week, a chat with a friend somehow led to us deciding to host an event. Not long into the discussion I thought, &amp;ldquo;Dang, I gotta create another website.</description>
