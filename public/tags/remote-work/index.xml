      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working from home for about six years. Before I became a software developer, I taught English as a second/foreign language online for a few years. It&amp;rsquo;s been so long since I last worked in a traditional office setting that working remotely has essentially become the norm for me.&#xA;I love all the benefits that come with working from home. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit in Atlanta traffic, I can wear shorts all day, and no one will look at me strangely when I talk to myself out loud.</description>
