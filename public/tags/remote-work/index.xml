      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working from home for about 6 years. Before I became a software developer, I taught English as a second/foreign language online for a few years. I loved the flexibility and when I made the decision to not only switch careers but also give up being self-employed, finding a remote gig was priority for me.&#xA;Thankfully, I was offered a role with a company that&amp;rsquo;s fully distributed. I was definitely ecstatic about keeping some semblance of normality because it had been a while since I last worked in an office setting (fingers crossed I never have to go back).</description>
