    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working from home for about six years. Before I became a software developer, I taught English as a second/foreign language online for a few years. It&rsquo;s been so long since I last worked in a traditional office setting that working remotely has essentially become the norm for me.</p>
<p>I love all the benefits that come with working from home. I don&rsquo;t have to sit in Atlanta traffic, I can wear shorts all day, and no one will look at me strangely when I talk to myself out loud.</p>
<p>Of course, with everything there are pros and cons. In my opinion, one of the main drawbacks of working from home is that it can be isolating. When I taught, there were days where I realized that I was barely making time to have conversations outside of the ones I was being paid to have.</p>
<p>Now, as a software developer, some days I don&rsquo;t interact much with my team. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing because I enjoy having days without meetings.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like my colleagues (no I didn&rsquo;t write that because some of them may read this), but it&rsquo;s also nice to have a day where I can focus on whatever I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
<p>Overcoming isolation can be a struggle and there could be other factors contributing to it beyond working remotely. I&rsquo;m definitely not an expert here, but in my experience, joining a group activity is a great way to socialize.</p>
<p>As an example, I joined a weightlifting group a few years ago. Not only did I get into a regular habit of exercise, but I also got to be around others who also wanted to talk about terrible reality TV shows.</p>
<p>Making time to regularly meet up with a colleague and not talk about work may also be helpful. Just because you&rsquo;re co-workers it doesn&rsquo;t mean that you can&rsquo;t make time to have non-work conversations. Eating lunch together or just having a chat once a week are great ways to interact.</p>
