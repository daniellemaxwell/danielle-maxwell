    <p>I&rsquo;ve been working from home for about 6 years. Before I became a software developer, I taught English as a second/foreign language online for a few years. I loved the flexibility and when I made the decision to not only switch careers but also give up being self-employed, finding a remote gig was priority for me.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I was offered a role with a company that&rsquo;s fully distributed. I was definitely ecstatic about keeping some semblance of normality because it had been a while since I last worked in an office setting (fingers crossed I never have to go back).</p>
<p>Since I primarily worked with adult students who wanted to improve their conversational skills, I used to talk a lot.</p>
<p>The lessons would range from 30 minutes to an hour. I even once had a student who preferred 90 minutes lessons. When I made unwise scheduling decisions, I could easily end up having 9 conversations a day.</p>
<p>All of this to say that it was a bit of a shock to my system when I wasn&rsquo;t interacting with others anywhere near as much after I started my job.</p>
<p>In the beginning, there was onboarding and I had some co-working sessions. There were meetings and I know there were several &ldquo;I need help with x&rdquo; calls, but it wasn&rsquo;t the same.</p>
<p>Everyone has work to do and having the time to focus on it is important. In fact, I even enjoy my no meeting days. At the same time, it can be difficult to adjust to.</p>
<p>So, what can be done to prevent feelings of isolation? There are a few studies here.</p>
<p>In my experience, find an activity you enjoy or want to learn and join a group for it. Want to learn a new language? Instead of taking private lessons, join a local or virtual group.</p>
