      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working from home for about six years. Before I became a software developer, I taught English as a second/foreign language online for a few years. It&amp;rsquo;s been so long since I last worked in a traditional office setting that working remotely has essentially become the norm for me.&#xA;I love all the benefits that come with working from home. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to sit in Atlanta traffic, I can wear shorts all day, and no one will look at me strangely when I talk to myself out loud.</description>

      <description>Next month, I will have been at the company that pays me for two years. I have grown so much over the past couple of years, and with this anniversary approaching I have been reflecting on areas for personal and professional improvement.&#xA;There are so many things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do and one is to become a better communicator. I&amp;rsquo;m not terrible or anything like that, but talking is so hard.</description>
