  <div class="single-content">
    <p>It has recently come to my attention that I often find reasons to create a website. Before learning how to code, I would make a WordPress site once I had an idea for anything.</p>
<p>None of these ideas went anywhere, btw. Marketing is important, but that&rsquo;s a topic for another day.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a chat with a friend somehow led to us deciding to host an event. Not long into the discussion I thought, &ldquo;Dang, I gotta create another website.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thankfully, within 24 hours I&rsquo;d walked back from this belief and decided I could easily use <a href="https://carrd.co/">Carrd</a> or <a href="https://convertkit.com/">Convertkit</a> to create a landing page. Though I&rsquo;d moved away from the idea of building a site from scratch, I hadn&rsquo;t figured out how to handle tickets.</p>
<p>There are plenty of event/ticketing platforms available, but my personal experiences with a few have been lacking. A Google search for alternatives didn&rsquo;t leave me all too excited about what was available and I was trying to limit fees. And this is how I decided I should develop a way to generate and then email a ticket after a buyer makes a purchase.</p>
<p>No lie, that sounds fun. Eventually I came back to reality. Sites like <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a> and <a href="https://www.make.com/">Make</a> exist for a reason.</p>
<p>Writing code is fun and building new things is a great way to learn. I think that as a software developer, it can be easy to fall into this belief that I have to code all the time. However, recognizing when to use perfectly fine tools instead of coding is just as important.</p>
<p>In my case, instead of trying to reinvent online ticketing I&rsquo;ve decided to use <a href="https://www.cheddarup.com/">Cheddar Up</a> after getting a recommendation from someone in <a href="https://www.discolink.com/club">DiscoLink Club</a>. The fees seem fair and it has everything needed to allow me to focus on helping organize this event.</p>
<p>Now, I just have to figure out how to market this thing.</p>
