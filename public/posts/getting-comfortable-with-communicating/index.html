  <div class="single-content">
    <p>Next month, I will have been at the company that pays me for two years. I have grown so much over the past couple of years, and with this anniversary approaching I have been reflecting on areas for personal and professional improvement.</p>
<p>There are so many things I&rsquo;d like to do and one is to become a better communicator. I&rsquo;m not terrible or anything like that, but talking is so hard.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I can talk for a very long time about several sports and why TV shows should not have more than 18 episodes per season. However, if you ask me what I&rsquo;m currently working on I will have to fight internally to ensure that I don&rsquo;t look like a deer caught in headlights.</p>
<p>Every time I submit to a CFP, I briefly try to talk myself out of it because what if I get chosen and then have to speak in front of people? Not only that but what will I do when people ask me questions? To be honest, I cringed a little after writing that.</p>
<p>But if speaking is hard, then let me tell you writing is so much worse. Writing has to be one of the most painful experiences I put myself through.</p>
<p>At the same time, I&rsquo;ve gained so much from giving talks and writing blogs. It&rsquo;s helped me learn so much and I wouldn&rsquo;t trade that for anything. So, over the next year I&rsquo;ve decided that my goal is not to become a better communicator but to feel more comfortable doing it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>
